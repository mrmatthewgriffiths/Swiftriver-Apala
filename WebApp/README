SWIFT RIVER v0.0.8 - Rumba
==========================
 
Swiftriver is a FOSS platform for determining the veracity and accuracy of news related to an event. 

There's a global emergency. Twitter, blogs and the news are all ablaze with rumor and reports.  Swiftriver's role in this scenario is to surface relevant information using probabilistic algorithms and crowd-sourcing, in real-time. Swift has an extremely modular design with support for plug-ins and hosted API services.  You can find out more about these at - http://swift.ushahidi.com/extend/
